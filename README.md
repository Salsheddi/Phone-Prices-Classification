Mobile devices have significantly changed how individuals work, socialize, plan, and entertain themselves. There are numerous companies that provide us with phones with varied features; as part of our project, we will compare the prices of phones from different companies depending on features like brand, operating system, storage, and others. We were interested in this dataset because we want to build a classification model that helps people choosing the right phone for them taking into consideration the features compared to the price.
