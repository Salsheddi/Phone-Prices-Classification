Mobile devices have significantly changed how individuals work, socialize, plan, and entertain themselves. There are numerous companies that provide us with phones with varied features; as part of our project, we will compare the prices of phones from different companies depending on features like brand, operating system, storage, and others.  We were interested in this dataset because we believe it to be a serious issue that phone prices are rising while their functionalities aren't changing all that much.
